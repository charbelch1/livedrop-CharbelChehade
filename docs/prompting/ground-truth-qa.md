### Q13: How do seller performance metrics affect visibility and penalties?
**Expected retrieval context:** Document 8: Shoplite Seller Account Setup and Management, Document 9: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers  
**Authoritative answer:** Shoplite continuously monitors key seller performance metrics such as **order defect rate, late shipment rate, and cancellation rate**. Sellers who meet or exceed expectations benefit from higher visibility in search results and recommendations. Conversely, repeated negative performance—such as overselling, inaccurate inventory, or frequent cancellations—can result in reduced visibility, penalties, or even account suspension.

**Authoritative answer:** In multi-seller checkout, buyers can add items from different sellers into a single cart, but shipping charges and fees remain **seller-specific**. Shoplite automatically calculates subtotals per seller, applies applicable shipping costs, and ensures that each seller’s return and refund policies are followed. Promotional codes can apply at either the cart level or the item level, depending on campaign rules. Commission fees are calculated on each completed sale individually, based on the seller’s category rates.

**Expected retrieval context:** Document 2: Shoplite Product Search and Filtering Features  
**Authoritative answer:** Shoplite personalizes search results for logged-in users by considering their browsing history, wish lists, and past purchases. This makes relevant products appear higher in the results and improves convenience.

Automated systems scan reviews for spam, offensive content, or fraudulent behavior, and a moderation team investigates flagged cases. Sellers cannot delete or edit buyer reviews directly, but they can **contest reviews** by submitting evidence through the Seller Dashboard if a review violates Shoplite’s guidelines. In such cases, the trust and safety team evaluates the claim and may remove or adjust the review if misuse is confirmed. Reviews also include filters by rating, date, and presence of media, while buyers can vote them as “helpful” or “not helpful.”
