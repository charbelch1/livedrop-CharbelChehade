## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration & Account Management


Creating and managing a Shoplite account is the first step for buyers and sellers who want to access the platform’s full set of e-commerce features. Registration is available through both the web portal and the mobile app. New users begin by providing a valid email address, creating a strong password that meets Shoplite’s security policy (minimum eight characters, at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol), and entering basic profile details such as name and country of residence. After submission, the system sends a verification link to the registered email. This link must be confirmed within **24 hours**, otherwise the account request will expire. Users can request a new verification email if necessary.  

Shoplite distinguishes between two primary account types: **buyer accounts** and **seller accounts**. Buyer accounts are free and allow customers to browse products, create wish lists, manage shopping carts, and complete purchases. Seller accounts require additional steps, including the submission of business credentials such as a commercial registration number, VAT ID, and proof of address. Seller verification generally takes **2–3 business days**, during which the account remains in review mode. Once approved, sellers gain access to inventory management tools, product listing dashboards, and performance analytics.  

For ongoing account management, users can update personal information, saved addresses, and notification preferences via the “My Account” section. Security features include optional **two-factor authentication (2FA)** through SMS or authenticator apps, as well as password reset functionality. If a user forgets their password, they can initiate a reset link sent to their registered email. Shoplite also enforces account lockout after multiple failed login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks.  

Finally, Shoplite emphasizes transparency and compliance with data protection standards. Users can download an activity log of their account history or request account deletion in line with privacy regulations. These processes ensure that Shoplite balances convenience with the security and trust essential for both buyers and sellers on the platform.

## Document 2: Shoplite Product Search and Filtering Features


Shoplite’s product search and filtering system is designed to help buyers quickly find relevant items across thousands of listings in the marketplace. At the core is a robust **search bar** that supports keyword queries, category-based browsing, and auto-suggestions. As users begin typing, Shoplite provides predictive search suggestions that include trending products, top categories, and relevant brands.  

Search results pages offer multiple filtering and sorting options to refine discovery. Common filters include price range, brand, seller rating, shipping speed, availability, and promotional eligibility. Buyers can also use advanced filters such as product specifications, size, and color. These filters can be combined to narrow results further, ensuring that shoppers can quickly locate the exact product they need. Sorting options include “Best Match,” “Lowest Price,” “Highest Price,” and “Most Popular.”  

Shoplite also integrates personalized search enhancements. For logged-in users, the platform considers browsing history, wish lists, and purchase patterns to recommend products higher in the results. While personalization improves convenience, buyers can toggle this feature off for a neutral view.  

Another important feature is **multi-seller search integration**. Since Shoplite hosts multiple vendors, the search engine aggregates results across sellers, highlighting those with higher ratings, faster shipping, or better prices. Buyers can view comparison tables for certain product categories (e.g., electronics) to evaluate options side by side.  

To support accessibility, Shoplite’s search interface includes voice search (available in the mobile app) and language-based filtering for international customers. Search sessions are preserved across devices, meaning that if a user starts browsing on the web and later switches to the mobile app, their search history and filters remain intact.  

In combination, these features make product discovery on Shoplite both efficient and user-friendly, giving buyers confidence that they can navigate the marketplace quickly and make informed purchasing decisions.

## Document 3: Shoplite Shopping Cart and Checkout Process


The Shoplite shopping cart is designed to provide flexibility and clarity for buyers purchasing from multiple sellers. Users can add products directly from search results or product detail pages. Each item in the cart displays essential details such as price, quantity, seller name, and estimated delivery time. The cart supports **multi-seller functionality**, allowing buyers to combine products from different vendors into a single checkout session while still maintaining seller-specific shipping and return policies.  

Within the cart, users can update quantities, remove items, or save products for later. Shoplite automatically calculates subtotals per seller, displays applicable shipping charges, and applies any **promotional codes** or coupons. Promo codes can be applied at either the cart level or the item level, depending on the campaign’s terms. If multiple codes are valid, Shoplite enforces a priority order to prevent conflicts and ensure fairness.  

During checkout, buyers must select a shipping address and delivery method from their saved address book. Shipping options typically include standard delivery, express shipping, or in-store pickup where available. Estimated delivery times are shown before final confirmation. For convenience, users can set a preferred payment method and shipping address as defaults.  

Shoplite also provides real-time checks for stock availability during checkout. If an item becomes unavailable, the platform alerts the user and suggests similar alternatives. In addition, a progress tracker highlights the checkout steps — **Cart → Address → Payment → Review → Confirmation** — ensuring buyers understand where they are in the process.  

Security is reinforced at the payment stage, where transactions pass through encrypted gateways and additional fraud-detection checks. Before confirming the order, buyers receive a detailed summary that includes itemized costs, discounts applied, shipping fees, and the total amount due. A confirmation email and digital invoice are sent immediately after successful payment.  

Overall, Shoplite’s cart and checkout flow is structured to maximize convenience while maintaining transparency and security, helping customers complete their purchases confidently.

## Document 4: Shoplite Payment Methods and Security


Shoplite provides a variety of secure payment methods to ensure buyers have flexibility while maintaining high safety standards. Accepted methods include major credit and debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), digital wallets (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay), and direct bank transfers in supported regions. For local markets, Shoplite partners with regional payment gateways to offer additional options such as cash-on-delivery (COD) or mobile money.  

Every transaction is processed through encrypted payment gateways that comply with **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**. Sensitive information such as card numbers is never stored on Shoplite’s servers; instead, tokenization is used to protect customer data. To comply with European regulations, Shoplite enforces **PSD2 / Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)**, requiring multi-factor verification for high-value transactions.  

Fraud prevention is another critical aspect. Shoplite uses real-time fraud detection systems that monitor unusual transaction patterns, location mismatches, or repeated failed payment attempts. Suspicious activity may trigger temporary holds or additional verification requests. Sellers are notified instantly of payment status changes, ensuring that orders are not shipped before confirmation.  

Refunds are handled through the same method as the original payment whenever possible. For example, purchases made with a credit card are refunded directly to that card, while PayPal and other wallets receive refunds to the same account. Refunds are usually processed within **5–7 business days**, though this may vary depending on the financial institution.  

To support buyers, Shoplite includes a secure “Saved Payment Methods” feature where customers can store card details safely for quicker checkout. This feature requires enabling two-factor authentication and is fully optional. Customers can remove saved methods at any time through the account settings page.  

Overall, Shoplite combines **payment flexibility, regulatory compliance, and fraud protection** to ensure that every purchase is convenient, transparent, and trustworthy for both buyers and sellers.

## Document 5: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery


Shoplite provides a transparent and reliable order tracking system that keeps buyers informed from the moment a purchase is confirmed until the item is delivered. Once an order is placed, customers receive a confirmation email containing the order number, estimated delivery date, and a link to the tracking dashboard. The dashboard is accessible through both the website and the mobile app under the “My Orders” section.  

The order journey typically moves through several stages: **Order Confirmed → Processing → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered.** Each stage is time-stamped, and buyers receive notifications when their order progresses. For shipments handled by third-party couriers, Shoplite integrates with their APIs to provide real-time tracking details such as package location, courier contact information, and expected delivery windows.  

Buyers can choose from multiple delivery options at checkout, including standard delivery, express shipping, and same-day delivery in select regions. The availability of options depends on the seller’s location and the buyer’s address. Express shipping includes priority handling, while standard delivery balances cost with reasonable timelines. Shoplite also supports in-store pickup when offered by participating sellers.  

For international orders, customs clearance times are displayed when available, and any additional duties or taxes are clearly communicated before purchase completion. Buyers can estimate delivery costs and times in advance by entering their postal code during checkout.  

If issues arise, such as delays or lost packages, buyers can initiate a support ticket directly from the tracking dashboard. Shoplite’s customer service team coordinates with the seller and courier to resolve the issue, often within **48 hours**. Additionally, delivery status is tied to the **return and refund system**, so buyers can only initiate a return once an item is officially marked as delivered. By combining multiple courier integrations, clear notifications, and user-friendly dashboards, Shoplite ensures that buyers stay informed and confident about their delivery experience.


## Document 6: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies


Shoplite’s return and refund policies are designed to balance buyer protection with fair treatment for sellers. In most cases, buyers are eligible to return products within a **30-day window** starting from the date of delivery. Products must be returned in their original condition, including packaging, manuals, and accessories. Certain categories such as perishable goods, digital downloads, or customized items may be excluded from the standard return policy, and these exceptions are clearly stated on the product detail pages.  

To initiate a return, buyers navigate to the “My Orders” section, select the relevant order, and choose the “Request Return” option. Shoplite then generates a **return authorization number (RAN)** and provides shipping instructions. Depending on the seller’s policies, return shipping may be free, subsidized, or the buyer’s responsibility. Items should be shipped back within **7 days** of receiving the authorization.  

Once the seller or fulfillment center receives the returned item, it is inspected for eligibility. If the return is approved, the refund process begins automatically. Refunds are issued to the original payment method whenever possible, typically within **5–7 business days** after approval. In cases where refunds cannot be processed to the original method (e.g., expired card), Shoplite provides wallet credits as an alternative.  

For defective or incorrect items, Shoplite ensures that the return shipping is always free and that refunds are processed on a priority basis. Buyers can also opt for replacements instead of refunds, subject to availability.  

Sellers are held accountable through Shoplite’s seller performance monitoring system. Excessive return requests, particularly for quality-related issues, can impact a seller’s rating and may lead to penalties or suspension. This ensures that sellers maintain high product quality and accurate descriptions.  

By combining a clear **30-day return policy**, straightforward processes, and reliable refund mechanisms, Shoplite fosters trust and confidence for buyers while maintaining fairness and accountability for sellers.

## Document 7: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings


Shoplite’s review and rating system provides buyers with the ability to share feedback and helps future customers make informed purchasing decisions. After a product is delivered, buyers receive an automated notification prompting them to leave a review. Reviews consist of a **star rating (1–5)** and optional written comments. Photos or short videos can also be uploaded to enhance credibility and showcase real-world product usage.  

The average product rating is displayed prominently on product detail pages, along with the total number of reviews. Reviews can be filtered by rating, date, and presence of media. Buyers can also upvote or flag reviews as “helpful” or “not helpful,” which influences the visibility of top reviews.  

To protect authenticity, Shoplite enforces a **verified purchase policy**, meaning only buyers who have completed a transaction for the product can leave a review. This prevents fake or promotional reviews from influencing ratings. Reviews are automatically scanned for inappropriate content, spam, or offensive language. Suspicious reviews are flagged for moderation by Shoplite’s trust and safety team.  

For sellers, reviews serve as a critical measure of performance. Products with consistently high ratings are more likely to appear in search results and recommendations. Conversely, repeated negative feedback can lower seller rankings, reduce visibility, and impact their commission rates. Shoplite provides sellers with an analytics dashboard that highlights common review themes, enabling them to improve product descriptions, packaging, or service quality.  

Buyers are encouraged to leave honest, constructive feedback. In cases where disputes arise — such as a seller contesting a review — Shoplite investigates and may remove content that violates guidelines. However, legitimate negative feedback is preserved to maintain transparency.  

Through a combination of verified reviews, rating transparency, and proactive moderation, Shoplite ensures that its review system remains trustworthy, useful, and beneficial to both buyers and sellers.

## Document 8: Shoplite Seller Account Setup and Management


Shoplite provides a dedicated pathway for businesses and individuals who want to sell products on the platform. To open a seller account, applicants must first create a basic Shoplite account and then upgrade to seller status by completing the **business verification process**. This includes submitting a valid commercial registration certificate, VAT or tax identification number (if applicable), and proof of address such as a utility bill. In some regions, sellers must also provide bank account information for payment settlements. Verification typically takes **2–3 business days**.  

Once approved, sellers gain access to the **Seller Dashboard**, the central hub for managing all business activities. From here, sellers can list new products, monitor inventory, adjust pricing, and analyze sales performance. Each product listing requires accurate titles, detailed descriptions, pricing, stock levels, and at least one image that meets Shoplite’s content standards. Listings are reviewed automatically for compliance with prohibited product rules before going live.  

Shoplite charges a **commission fee** on each sale, which varies by category. These fees, along with shipping charges and promotional discounts, are clearly itemized in the financial reports section of the Seller Dashboard. Sellers can also request payouts, which are typically processed on a **weekly or bi-weekly basis**, depending on the payment method and region.  

To ensure ongoing compliance, sellers must maintain high standards of accuracy, shipping reliability, and customer service. Performance metrics such as **order defect rate, late shipment rate, and cancellation rate** are continuously monitored. Falling below acceptable thresholds can result in warnings, reduced visibility in search results, or account suspension.  

Shoplite provides sellers with support resources, including onboarding tutorials, community forums, and access to a dedicated support channel for urgent issues. Sellers are also encouraged to participate in promotional campaigns, which can boost visibility but may include additional fees.  

By combining thorough verification, powerful management tools, and strict performance monitoring, Shoplite ensures that its seller ecosystem remains professional, trustworthy, and competitive.

## Document 9: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers


Effective inventory management is critical for sellers on Shoplite to maintain smooth operations and meet customer expectations. The **Seller Dashboard** provides a centralized inventory management module where sellers can view, update, and control stock levels across all listed products. Each product listing requires an accurate stock count, and sellers can configure minimum quantity alerts to receive notifications when items approach low availability.  

Sellers may choose between **manual updates** and **automated syncing**. Manual updates are done directly through the dashboard or by uploading bulk inventory files in CSV format. Automated syncing is available via Shoplite’s API, enabling real-time updates from a seller’s warehouse or third-party software. This prevents overselling and ensures that customers always see the most accurate stock availability.  

Shoplite also supports **multi-warehouse management**, allowing sellers to assign different stock quantities to multiple fulfillment centers. This is especially useful for businesses operating in multiple regions, as it helps reduce delivery times and shipping costs. The system automatically routes orders to the nearest warehouse with available stock.  

To minimize disruptions, sellers can activate **backorder or pre-order options** for selected products. Backorders allow buyers to place orders for items that are temporarily out of stock, with an estimated restock date clearly displayed. Pre-orders are used for upcoming product launches and include promotional tools to generate customer interest before release.  

Analytics within the dashboard provide insights into sales velocity, seasonal demand, and forecasted stock requirements. Sellers can identify best-selling products, track aging inventory, and adjust procurement strategies accordingly. Reports can be exported for integration with accounting and supply chain systems.  

Failure to maintain accurate inventory levels may lead to canceled orders, negative reviews, and penalties. Shoplite enforces strict rules around overselling, requiring sellers to update stock levels promptly. Excessive cancellations due to stock mismanagement can lower a seller’s performance rating and visibility in search results.  

By offering both manual and automated inventory tools, real-time syncing, and data-driven analytics, Shoplite empowers sellers to keep their operations efficient and reliable.

## Document 10: Shoplite Commission and Fee Structure


Shoplite uses a transparent commission and fee structure to ensure fairness across its multi-seller marketplace. Every sale completed on the platform is subject to a **commission fee**, which varies by product category. For example, electronics may carry a 5% fee, while fashion and apparel may incur a 10% fee. Commission is calculated on the final sale price, excluding taxes and shipping. Sellers can view category-specific rates in the Seller Dashboard under the “Payments & Fees” section.  

In addition to commission, certain **service fees** may apply. These include payment processing fees for transactions made via credit cards or digital wallets, typically ranging from 1–3% depending on the payment method. If a seller participates in Shoplite promotions, such as sponsored ads or discount campaigns, additional charges may apply. These are always disclosed before enrollment.  

Shipping fees are generally paid by the buyer, but if sellers opt to provide **free shipping**, they must cover the cost themselves. In some regions, Shoplite offers subsidized shipping programs where costs are shared between the platform and the seller.  

Payouts to sellers are processed on a **weekly or bi-weekly schedule**, depending on account settings and regional banking policies. Sellers can track detailed breakdowns of commissions, service fees, and net payouts in the Seller Dashboard’s financial reports. These reports also highlight any adjustments due to refunds, returns, or disputes. Refund-related fees are not charged to sellers if the return is due to a defective or misrepresented product, but discretionary returns (such as buyer’s remorse) may still reduce the seller’s net payout.  

To maintain compliance, Shoplite issues end-of-year financial summaries that sellers can use for tax reporting. International sellers may also be subject to VAT or GST rules depending on their jurisdiction.  

Overall, Shoplite’s commission and fee model is designed to balance platform sustainability with seller profitability, ensuring that costs are clear, predictable, and aligned with marketplace standards.

## Document 11: Shoplite Customer Support Procedures


Shoplite’s customer support system is designed to provide quick and effective assistance to both buyers and sellers. Support is available through multiple channels, including **live chat**, **email**, and a **24/7 help center** accessible via the website and mobile app. For urgent issues, buyers and sellers can also request a callback from a Shoplite support representative.  

Common inquiries include order tracking, payment issues, return and refund requests, account access problems, and seller performance disputes. To streamline responses, Shoplite uses an AI-powered help center that provides suggested solutions and FAQs before escalating to human agents. This helps resolve simpler questions instantly, while more complex cases are assigned to the appropriate support team.  

When raising a support ticket, users are asked to provide their **order number, account email, and a short description of the issue**. Tickets are categorized by priority: high-priority cases include failed payments, lost packages, and account security concerns. Standard response times are within **24 hours**, though urgent cases are typically handled within **2–4 hours**.  

For sellers, a dedicated **Seller Support Team** assists with onboarding, listing approvals, and policy compliance. Sellers can also access community forums where they can share best practices and solutions with peers.  

Shoplite emphasizes transparency in the resolution process. Once a ticket is opened, users can track its progress through the “My Support” dashboard, which shows status updates such as “In Review,” “Escalated,” or “Resolved.” After resolution, users are invited to rate the support experience, and feedback is monitored to improve service quality.  

To maintain accountability, Shoplite keeps an archive of all support interactions. Buyers and sellers can reference past tickets to resolve recurring issues. Repeated negative experiences are escalated to senior support teams, ensuring no problem is left unresolved.  

By combining self-service tools, responsive live agents, and clear escalation policies, Shoplite delivers customer support that is fast, transparent, and user-friendly.

## Document 12: Shoplite Mobile App Features


The Shoplite mobile app extends the full functionality of the platform to smartphones and tablets, offering buyers and sellers a seamless shopping and management experience. The app is available for both **iOS and Android** devices and is optimized for performance, accessibility, and ease of use.  

For buyers, the app includes a **personalized homepage** that highlights trending products, recommendations based on browsing history, and ongoing promotions. The search functionality mirrors the web version, with keyword suggestions, advanced filters, and voice search integration. Buyers can add products to their cart or wish list, track deliveries in real-time, and manage return requests directly through the app. Push notifications provide instant updates on price drops, order status, and promotional campaigns.

Buyers can store multiple shipping addresses and payment methods securely in their profile, enabling quick one-tap purchases. For international customers, the app provides built-in language support and localized currency displays.  

Sellers benefit from a dedicated **Shoplite Seller App Mode**, which can be toggled from the main menu. In this mode, sellers can monitor sales, manage product listings, and respond to buyer inquiries on the go. They also receive alerts for low inventory, new orders, and support tickets. The seller analytics dashboard provides mobile-friendly insights into sales performance, customer reviews, and advertising campaign results.  

Additional features include **offline browsing**, where previously viewed product pages are cached for later access, and biometric login options such as fingerprint or facial recognition for added security.  

By combining convenience, personalization, and powerful seller tools, the Shoplite mobile app ensures that users can stay connected to the marketplace anytime, anywhere.

## Document 13: Shoplite API Documentation for Developers


Shoplite provides a comprehensive set of **RESTful APIs** that enable developers to integrate platform functionality into third-party applications, services, and tools. These APIs cover a wide range of use cases, including product catalog management, order processing, user account synchronization, and reporting. API access is available to registered developers through the **Shoplite Developer Portal**, where credentials, documentation, and sample code are provided.  

Authentication is handled via **OAuth 2.0**, ensuring secure token-based access. Developers must first register their application in the portal to obtain client IDs and secrets. Tokens are short-lived for security purposes, and refresh tokens are used to maintain longer sessions. All API traffic is encrypted using HTTPS, and rate limits apply to prevent abuse. Standard rate limits allow up to **1,000 requests per minute** per application, though higher tiers are available for enterprise partners.  

Key API endpoints include:  
- **/products** – Create, update, or query product listings.  
- **/orders** – Retrieve order details, update shipping status, and process refunds.  
- **/users** – Manage customer accounts, addresses, and preferences (with appropriate permissions).  
- **/reports** – Generate sales, inventory, and performance analytics.  

For sellers, APIs can be integrated with existing **ERP, CRM, or inventory management systems**, enabling real-time synchronization of stock levels and automated order fulfillment. Developers can also build custom dashboards that leverage Shoplite data for advanced analytics.  

The documentation provides **sandbox environments** where developers can test integrations without impacting live data. Error handling guidelines and standardized response codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized) are included to streamline debugging.  

Shoplite actively supports developers through its technical forums, dedicated support channels, and regular API update announcements. By offering a secure, scalable, and developer-friendly API ecosystem, Shoplite empowers businesses to extend the platform’s functionality and create custom solutions tailored to their operations.

## Document 14: Shoplite Security and Privacy Policies


Shoplite places a strong emphasis on protecting the personal and financial data of its users. All communications between customers, sellers, and Shoplite servers are encrypted using **TLS 1.3**, ensuring that sensitive information cannot be intercepted. For transactions, Shoplite adheres to **PCI DSS** standards, and card data is tokenized to avoid direct storage of payment credentials.  

User accounts benefit from robust **authentication measures**, including optional two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS or authenticator apps. Account lockout mechanisms prevent brute-force login attempts, while automated anomaly detection flags suspicious access patterns, such as logins from unfamiliar devices or regions.  

Privacy policies align with global data protection standards, including **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** and **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**. Users can access, download, or delete their personal data directly from the “My Account” section. Shoplite commits to using personal information only for legitimate business purposes such as order fulfillment, fraud prevention, and customer support.  

For developers and sellers, API integrations are secured with **OAuth 2.0**, scoped access tokens, and strict rate limits. Sellers are prohibited from storing or misusing customer information beyond what is required for fulfilling orders. Violations of data handling policies can result in account suspension or legal action.  

Shoplite also conducts **regular third-party security audits** and penetration testing to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and resolved promptly. A public bug bounty program rewards ethical hackers for responsibly disclosing security flaws. In addition, Shoplite maintains a transparent incident response plan, notifying users promptly if a data breach or critical vulnerability occurs.  

Educational resources are available to help users and sellers recognize phishing attempts, fraudulent websites, or suspicious messages. By fostering awareness and combining technological safeguards with regulatory compliance, Shoplite ensures a secure and trustworthy environment for all marketplace participants.

## Document 15: Shoplite Promotional Codes and Discounts


Promotional codes and discounts are an integral part of Shoplite’s strategy to enhance buyer engagement and help sellers increase sales. Buyers can apply **promo codes** during checkout to receive benefits such as percentage discounts, flat-rate deductions, or free shipping. Promo codes may apply to the entire cart, a specific seller, or individual items. Each code includes terms and conditions, such as minimum purchase amounts, product category restrictions, or expiration dates.  

Shoplite enforces a **priority system** when multiple discounts are available. Cart-level discounts are applied first, followed by item-level codes. In cases where codes conflict, the platform automatically selects the option that provides the buyer with the maximum allowable benefit, while ensuring sellers are not disadvantaged. Promo codes cannot typically be combined unless explicitly stated in the offer.  

Sellers can create their own promotional campaigns through the **Seller Dashboard**, including flash sales, buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offers, and seasonal discounts. Shoplite provides detailed analytics that track redemption rates, customer engagement, and revenue impact, allowing sellers to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns.  

For buyers, promotional offers are highlighted across the platform, including banners on the homepage, dedicated “Deals” sections, and personalized recommendations. Push notifications on the mobile app also alert customers when codes are about to expire or when new promotions match their shopping history.  

Shoplite occasionally issues **platform-wide discount codes** during major events such as holidays, anniversaries, or seasonal sales. These codes are funded by Shoplite itself and apply across multiple categories.  

To prevent misuse, promo codes are limited to one use per account unless otherwise stated. The system monitors for fraudulent activity, such as multiple accounts created to exploit offers. Violations may lead to suspension of promotional privileges or account termination.  

By balancing attractive buyer incentives with clear rules for sellers, Shoplite’s promotional code and discount system fosters trust, boosts sales, and enhances the overall shopping experience.

## Document 16: Shoplite Mobile Notifications & Alerts


Shoplite uses a comprehensive notification system to keep both buyers and sellers informed in real time. Notifications are delivered through the mobile app as **push alerts**, via email, or SMS (in supported regions). Buyers receive notifications for key events such as **order confirmations, shipping updates, delivery reminders, return approvals, and promotional offers**. These timely alerts ensure that customers always know the status of their orders and never miss out on important deals.  

Sellers benefit from notifications about **new orders, low inventory alerts, performance warnings, and customer inquiries**. Critical updates, such as account verification status or urgent support tickets, are prioritized and delivered immediately. This allows sellers to stay proactive and maintain high service standards.  

Users have control over their notification preferences. In the **Account Settings** section, buyers and sellers can choose which alerts they want to receive, opt out of promotional messages, or switch between push notifications and email. For sensitive updates like security alerts (e.g., login from a new device), Shoplite enforces mandatory delivery to ensure user awareness.  

To reduce notification fatigue, Shoplite employs **smart batching**, grouping less urgent updates (such as promotional messages) into a single daily summary. Meanwhile, urgent notifications like “Out for Delivery” or “Low Stock” are sent immediately.  

The notification system also supports **multi-language content**, ensuring international users receive updates in their preferred language. For global campaigns, Shoplite tailors alerts to local time zones so that users receive messages at appropriate times.  

By combining customization, real-time delivery, and smart prioritization, Shoplite’s notification system strengthens communication, improves order transparency, and boosts buyer–seller engagement across the platform.

## Document 17: Shoplite Dispute Resolution & Buyer Protection


Shoplite is committed to ensuring that transactions between buyers and sellers are secure, transparent, and fair. To achieve this, the platform provides a structured **dispute resolution system** combined with comprehensive **buyer protection policies**. These measures safeguard customers from fraudulent activity, misrepresented products, and unresolved service issues, while ensuring that sellers are treated fairly in the process.  

If a buyer encounters a problem — such as receiving the wrong item, a defective product, or not receiving an order at all — they can file a **dispute** through the “My Orders” section. Each dispute requires supporting evidence, such as photos, order confirmations, or tracking numbers. Once submitted, the dispute is reviewed by Shoplite’s Resolution Team, which mediates between the buyer and the seller. Sellers are notified immediately and are expected to respond within **3 business days**.  

Buyer protection policies guarantee refunds in cases of non-delivery or clear product misrepresentation. In most cases, refunds are processed within **5–10 business days** once the dispute is resolved in the buyer’s favor. If the seller provides sufficient proof (such as confirmed delivery or product authenticity), the dispute may be closed without refund, but Shoplite ensures that decisions are based on documented evidence.  

For sellers, the dispute system encourages accountability but also protects against fraudulent claims. Repeated disputes against a seller trigger performance reviews, and unresolved or high-volume complaints can result in penalties, reduced visibility, or account suspension. However, sellers who provide timely responses and resolutions may mitigate negative impact on their performance ratings.  

Shoplite also offers an **escalation pathway**. If buyers or sellers are unsatisfied with the initial resolution, they can escalate the dispute for further review. Complex cases may involve external verification or third-party mediation, depending on local laws.  

By combining clear buyer protection guarantees, evidence-based dispute handling, and balanced enforcement mechanisms, Shoplite strengthens trust across the marketplace and ensures that all participants can transact with confidence.
